      // Let's say we have an array
      const players = ["Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "Poppy"];

      // and we want to make a copy of it.

      // You might think we can just do something like this:
      const bulls = players;
      console.log(players, bulls);

      // however what happens when we update that array?
      bulls[3] = "Rose";

      // now here is the problem!
      console.log(players, bulls);

      // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

      // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

      // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

      // one way
      let lakers = bulls.slice();
      lakers[3] = "James";
      console.log(bulls, lakers);

      // or create a new array and concat the old one in
      let suns = [].concat(lakers);

      // or use the new ES6 Spread
      let warriors = [...players];
      let nicks = Array.from(bulls);
      nicks[3] = "Russell";
      console.log(`bulls, ${bulls}\nnicks, ${nicks}`);
      console.log(warriors, nicks);

      // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

      // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

      // with Objects
      const person = {
        name: "Wes Bos",
        age: 80,
      };

      // and think we make a copy:
      const someBody = person;
      // someBody.number = 1;
      // console.log(person);

      // how do we take a copy instead?
      const someBody2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 87 });
      console.log(person);
      console.log(someBody2);

      // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
      const someBody3 = { ...person };
      someBody3.name = "Rex";
      console.log(person, someBody3);

      // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
      someBody3.number = { home: 0654321, mobile: 0987654321 };
